NetRME.service is a basic service example to have [software] automatically run at startup. To use this you must ensure the file location in the script is correct for your system and follow these instructions:

Copy: NetRME.service to /lib/systemd/system/

Execute: systemctl daemon-reload

Execute: systemctl enable NetRME.service

When you boot the latest build of [software] will run automatically.

To debug or rebuild [software] you can use the ./stopService script.
